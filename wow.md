Escaping the world now only known as Outland, the Orcs of the Shadowclan emerge to a new land and destiny. 


### What Shadowclan is About
**Making the game more fun**
We have fun and increase the fun for others too.

### Open Membership
**Anyone can make a Shadowclan orc and join.**

### Roleplay
We are always in-character while in-game.

### Fiercely Independent
We are hostile to Alliance, distrustful of non-orcs, and wary of anyone not in Shadowclan. We are also very territorial.

### Respect
We respect other players as fellow players.

### Quality
We train our members in the Shadowclan ways and our expectations are enforced.

### Commitment
In order to stay in Shadowclan after an initial trial period, members must permanently commit their character to Shadowclan.

### Community
Shadowclan members work together and share supplies freely among themselves.

### Game Friendly
Our storyline and background blend in with game's storyline and background to the highest degree possible. We won't force other players to break character in order to match our own roleplay style. We follow the rules of the game. No cheating, bug exploiting, illegal 3rd party programs, or other violations of the game's Terms of Service are ever allowed.

### Want to make an alternate character?
Shadowclan is designed to not only be fun for someone's primary character, but also a great guild for alternate characters, offering an alternative style of playing the game that you rarely find in other guilds.
